<p><em>Engineering materials</em> refers to the group of materials that are used in the construction of manmade structures and components. The primary function of an engineering material is to withstand applied loading without breaking and without exhibiting excessive deflection.  The major classifications of engineering materials include metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. The important characteristics of the materials within each of these classes are discussed on this page, and tables of material properties are also provided.</p>

<h2 style="color: darkcyan;" id="1"><b>Metals</b></h2>
<p>Metals are the most commonly used class of engineering material. Metal alloys are especially common, and they are formed by combining a metal with one or more other metallic and/or non-metallic materials. The combination usually occurs through a process of melting, mixing, and cooling. The goal of alloying is to improve the properties of the base material in some desirable way.</p>
<p>Metal alloy compositions are described in terms of the percentages of the various elements in the alloy, where the percentages are measured by weight.</p>
<h3>Ferrous Alloys</h3>
<p>Ferrous alloys have iron as the base element. These alloys and include steels and cast irons. Ferrous alloys are the most common metal alloys in use due to the abundance of iron, ease of production, and high versatility of the material. The biggest disadvantage of many ferrous alloys is low corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>Carbon is an important alloying element in all ferrous alloys. In general, higher levels of carbon increase strength and hardness, and decrease ductility and weldability.</p>
<h3>Aluminum Alloys</h3>
<p>Pure aluminum is soft and weak, but it can be alloyed to increase strength. Pure aluminum has good corrosion resistance due to an oxide coating that forms over the material and prevents oxidation. Alloying the aluminum tends to reduce its corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>Aluminum is a widely used material, particularly in the aerospace industry, due to its light weight and corrosion resistance. Despite the fact that aluminum alloys are generally not as strong as steels, they nevertheless have a good strength-to-weight ratio.</p>
<h3>Nickel Alloys</h3>
<p>Nickel alloys have high temperature and corrosion resistance. Common alloying ingredients include copper, chromium, and iron. Common nickel alloys include Monel, K-Monel, Inconel, and Hastelloy.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Copper Alloys</h3>
<P>Copper alloys are generally characterized as being electrically conductive, having good corrosion resistance, and being relatively easy to form and cast. While they are a useful engineering material, copper alloys are also very attractive and are commonly used in decorative applications.</P>
<p>Copper alloys primarily consist of brasses and bronzes. Zinc is the major alloying ingredient in brass. Tin is a major alloying element in most bronzes. Bronzes may also contain aluminum, nickel, zinc, silicon, and other elements. The bronzes are typically stronger than the brasses while still maintaining good corrosion resistance.</p>
<h3>Titanium Alloys</h3>
<p>Titanium alloys are light, strong, and have high corrosion resistance. Their density is much lower than steel, and their strength-to-weight ratio is excellent. For this reason, titanium alloys are used fairly commonly, especially in the aerospace industry. One primary downside of titanium alloys is the high cost.</p>
<p>There are three categories of titanium alloys: alpha alloys, beta alloys, and alpha-beta alloys. Alpha alloys do not respond to heat treatment and are instead strengthened through solid-solution strengthening processes. The beta and alpha-beta alloys can be strengthened by heat treatment, primarily through precipitation hardening.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color: darkcyan;" id="2"><b>Polymers</b></h2>
<p>Polymers are materials that consist of molecules formed by long chains of repeating units. They may be natural or synthetic. Many useful engineering materials are polymers, such as plastics, rubbers, fibers, adhesives, and coatings. Polymers are classified as thermoplastic polymers, thermosetting polymers (thermosets), and elastomers.</p>

<h3>Thermoplastic Polymers</h3>
<p>The classification of thermoplastics and thermosets is based on their response to heat. If heat is applied to a thermoplastic, it will soften and melt. Once it is cooled, it will return to solid form. Thermoplastics do not experience any chemical change through repeated heating and cooling (unless the temperature is high enough to break the molecular bonds). They are therefore very well suited to injection molding.</p>

<h3>Thermosetting Polymers</h3>
<p>Thermosets are typically heated during initial processing, after which they become permanently hard. Thermosets will not melt upon reheating. If the applied heat becomes extreme however, the thermoset will degrade due to breaking of the molecular bonds. Thermosets typically have greater hardness and strength than thermoplastics. They also typically have better dimensional stability than thermoplastics, meaning that they are better at maintaining their original dimensions when subjected to temperature and moisture changes.</p>

<h3>Elastomers</h3>
<p>Elastomers are highly elastic polymers with mechanical properties similar to rubber. Elastomers are commonly used for seals, adhesives, hoses, belts, and other flexible parts. The strength and stiffness of rubber can be increased through a process called vulcanization, which involves adding sulfur and subjecting the material to high temperature and pressure. This process causes cross-links to form between the polymer chains.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color: darkcyan;" id="3">Ceramics</h2>
<p>Ceramics are solid compounds that may consist of metallic or nonmetallic elements. The primary classifications of ceramics include glasses, cements, clay products, refractories, and abrasives.</p>
<p>Ceramics generally have excellent corrosion and wear resistance, high melting temperature, high stiffness, and low electrical and thermal conductivity. Ceramics are also very brittle materials.</p>

<h3>Glass</h3>
<p>Glasses are common materials and are seen in applications including windows, lenses, and containers. Glasses are amorphous, whereas the other ceramics are mainly crystalline. Primary advantages of glasses include transparency and ease of fabrication. The base element of most glasses is silica, and other components can be added to modify its properties. Common processes used to form glass include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>heating until melting, then pouring into molds to cast into useful shapes    </li>
    <li>heating until soft, then rolling</li>
    <li>heating until soft, then blowing into desired shapes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cements</h3>
<p>Cements are materials that, after mixing with water, form a paste that then hardens. Because of this characteristic, cements can be formed into useful shapes while in paste form before they harden into rigid structures. Plaster of paris is one common cement. The most common cement is called Portland cement, which is made by mixing clay and limestone and then firing at high temperature. Portland cement is used to form concrete, which is made by mixing it with sand, gravel, and water. It can also be mixed with sand and water to form mortar. Like other ceramics, cements are weak in tension but strong in compression. Cement is very inexpensive to produce, and it is used widely in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other large structures.</p>
<h3>Clay products</h3>
<p>Clay is a very common ceramic material. It can be mixed with water, shaped, and then hardened through firing at high temperature. The two primary classifications of clay products include structural clay products and whitewares. Structural clay products see applications including bricks, tiles, and piping. Whitewares see applications including pottery and plumbing fixtures.</p>
<h3>Refractories</h3>
<p>Refractory ceramics can withstand high temperatures and extreme environments. They can also provide thermal insulation. Brick is the most common refractory ceramic.</p>
<h3>Abrasives</h3>
<p>Abrasive ceramics are hard materials that are used to cut, grind, and wear away other softer materials. Typical properties of abrasives include high hardness, wear resistance, and temperature resistance. Abrasives can either be bonded to a surface (e.g., grinding wheels and sandpaper), or can be used as loose grains (e.g., sand blasting). Common abrasives include cemented carbide, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, aluminum oxide, and silica sand. Diamond is also an excellent abrasive, but it is expensive.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color: darkcyan;" id="4">Composites</h2>
<p>A composite material is a material in which one or more mutually insoluble materials are mixed or bonded together. The primary classes of composites are particulate composites, fibrous composites, and laminated composites.</p>
<h3>Particulate Composites</h3>
<p>Particulate composites are created by adding particles of one material to a matrix (the filler material). The particles will typically account for less than 15% of the total material volume. The particles are added to improve upon some shortcoming of the matrix material.</p>
<h3>Fibrous Composites</h3>
<p>A fibrous composite is a material in which fibers of one material are embedded within a matrix. The fibers carry most of the stress, and the matrix serves to hold the fibers in place and to transmit stress between the fibers. The fibers can be short and randomly oriented, or they can be long and continuous.</p>
<h3>Laminated Composites</h3>
<p>Laminated composites are created by combining layers of composite materials. The layers will typically differ in the orientation of the fibers, or they will differ in the material itself. Sandwich materials are common, in which a lightweight material (such as foam or a honeycomb) will be placed in between layers of a strong, stiff material.</p>
